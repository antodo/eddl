Installation
============

.. image:: ../_static/images/logos/conda.svg


Using the Conda package
-----------------------

A package for EDDL is available on Anaconda_.
You can use one of the following lines according to your needs:

.. tabs::

    .. tab:: CPU

        .. code:: bash

            conda install -c deephealth eddl-cpu

        .. note::

            - Platforms supported: Linux x86/x64 and MacOS

    .. tab:: GPU

        .. code:: bash

            conda install -c deephealth eddl-gpu

        .. note::

            - Platforms supported: Linux x86/x64


.. image:: ../_static/images/logos/homebrew.svg


Using the Homebrew package
--------------------------

A package for EDDL is available on the homebrew package manager.
You need to run both lines, one to add the tap and the other to install the library.

.. code:: bash

    # Add deephealth tap
    brew tap deephealthproject/homebrew-tap

    # Install EDDL
    brew install eddl

From source with cmake
----------------------

You can also install ``EDDL`` from source with cmake.

On Unix platforms, from the source directory:


.. tabs::

    .. tab:: Linux

        .. code:: bash

            # Download source code
            git clone https://github.com/deephealthproject/eddl.git
            cd eddl/

            # Install dependencies
            conda env create -f environment.yml
            conda activate eddl

            # Build and install
            mkdir build
            cd build
            cmake ..  # -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/dir -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/dir  # (optional)
            make install

    .. tab:: MacOS

        .. code:: bash

            # Download source code
            git clone https://github.com/deephealthproject/eddl.git
            cd eddl/

            # Install dependencies
            conda env create -f environment.yml
            conda activate eddl

            # Build and install
            mkdir build
            cd build
            cmake ..  # -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/dir -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/dir  # (optional)

            make install


See the :doc:`build-options` section for more details about cmake options.

.. note::

    You can ignore ``-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`` and ``-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`` to use their default values,
    or if you prefer it, you can specificy your environment like ``-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$CONDA_PREFIX``.

    If you want to distribute the resulting shared library, you should use the flag
    ``-DBUILD_SUPERBUILD=ON`` so that we can make specific tunings to our dependencies.


Including EDDL in your project
---------------------------------

The different packages of ``EDDL`` are built with cmake, so whatever the
installation mode you choose, you can add ``EDDL`` to your project using cmake:

.. code:: cmake

    find_package(eddl REQUIRED)
    target_link_libraries(your_target PUBLIC EDDL::eddl)

.. note::

    After ``find_package``, you can access library components with theses variables:
    ``EDDL_ROOT``, ``EDDL_INCLUDE_DIR``, ``EDDL_LIBRARIES_DIR`` and ``EDDL_LIBRARIES``.
